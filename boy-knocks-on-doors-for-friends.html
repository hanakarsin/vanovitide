In July 2023, a bullied Texas boy went viral on <a href=#>TikTok</a> after knocking on his neighbor's door to ask if they knew anyone he could be friends with. He told them, "I need some friends, like really bad."</p><p>Read on for the rest of the heart-wrenching story. Plus, stick around to find out how the little boy's neighbor showed him kindness and raised nearly $40,000 in his name!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok / @brennanray</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A bullied boy knocked on doors looking for new friends.</h2><p>In the viral video, which amassed over 67 million views on TikTok in just five days, the young boy ‚Äî Shayden Walker ‚Äî nervously approached his neighbor's house.</p><p>"What's up, man?" the creator, Brennan Ray, asked from his doorbell camera. Shayden responded, "I just wanted to see if you knew any kids around like, 11 or 12, maybe because I need some friends, like really bad."</p><p>Brennan told him a few kids live in a house down the street, but Shayden revealed he's no longer friends with them because they bullied him in the past and "keep bullying" him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@brennanray href=#>@brennanray</a><p>Its takes 2 seconds to make someones day, you never know what people are going through until you get a chance to talk to them.

I actually ... I love 2-year-olds, to be honest. They're just the cutest things I've ever known," the boy said, adding that he "used to have" a 2-year-old sister (she's since grown up).</p><p>Shayden then told Brennan his name, who said he'll say hello to the young boy if he ever sees him in the area. The pair bid each other goodbye, with Shayden telling Brennan to "have a good day."</p><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up video</a> showed the bullied boy slowly walking up the steps to Brennan and his wife Angel's home about a half hour earlier; Shayden shied away but soon built up the courage and went back.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The boy's neighbors set up a GoFundMe for him and raised nearly $40,000.</h2><p>Shortly after meeting him, Brennan and Angel <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">launched a GoFundMe for Shayden</a> to help him make friends. The pair said the money would go toward "a gaming system, school clothes, and hopefully some amusement park tickets and anything else he may want or need."</p><p>The couple raised $37,257, far surpassing their initial $7,000 goal!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@brennanray href=#>@brennanray</a><p>Thank you all for your generosity and kindness!

We'll keep you updated along the way. Thank you! #kindnessmatters."</p><p>After officially closing the GoFundMe, the couple shared another video to TikTok and said they were trying to set up a time and place to meet with Shayden. Thankfully, the "meeting of the century" happened!</p><p>On July 9, the couple and their 2-year-old daughter, AnaVeah, met Shayden for the first time.
