PRESIDENT” that Buhari declined assent in order to protect ordinary Nigerians from exploitation.</p><p>He stated that President Buhari remains committed to protecting the interest of Nigeria’s democracy and Nigerians adding that he won’t be blackmailed by the voices trying to paint him in a bad light for not signing the amended bill.</p><p>The proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has stated that Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State and his predecessor, Senator Rochas Okorocha are not their sponsors.</p><p>Naija News reports that the Biafra group disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday issued by its Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful.</p><p>The group revealed that its supporters and members in Nigeria and abroad are the sources of its sponsorship, dissociating itself from any politician.</p><p>IPOB boasted that no singular individual can be its sponsor, adding that it doesn’t need governor Uzodinma, Senator Okorocha or his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu as its sponsor.</p><p>Uche Nwosu has stated that he thought the security operatives who apprehended him at St Peter’s Anglican church Eziama Obaire in the Nkwerre Local Government Area of Imo state last Sunday, December 26 would assassinate him.</p><p>Nwosu revealed his experience to newsmen in Owerri, the state capital on Tuesday, December 28.</p><p>The politician alleged that the order for his arrest was given by Hope Uzodinma, the current governor of Imo state.</p><p>He recalled how he was arrested in church, stripped half-naked, handcuffed and taken to Enugu airport where he was placed in a chartered airplane.</p><p>Nwosu said he thought the men were going to assassinate him from the way he was being handled.</p><p>The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki on Tuesday said those criticizing him for forgiving a political enforcer, Tony Adun popularly known as Tony Kabaka don’t understand the concept of forgiveness.</p><p>This is at the Governor argued that his supporters criticizing his move to forgive the All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain are not his true supporters.</p><p>Obaseki made the submission on Tuesday while addressing leaders of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Oredo Local Government Area of the state over the reactions that followed his decision to forgive Kabaka and give him Christmas gifts.</p><p>Naija News earlier reported that Kabaka got Christmas gifts of a cow and bags of rice from the Edo State government after he repented and begged for forgiveness.</p><p>However, some political watchers and stakeholders in Edo State seemed not pleased with the development.</p><p>Addressing the issue on Tuesday, Governor Obaseki said humility and forgiveness should be the hallmark of any politician and it must always be remembered that humanity comes before politics.</p><p>He added that he is merely a mortal who has also received forgiveness from God so why shouldn’t he forgive a fellow human being who has begged for forgiveness articularly at a time Christmas is being celebrated.</p><p>The spokesperson of embattled Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, Olayomi Koiki has alleged that the government of Benin Republic and the federal government of Nigeria are planning to kill his principal in custody.</p><p>Koiki made the allegation on Tuesday during a podcast monitored by Naija News.</p><p>According to him, the plan is to silence Igboho and other leaders of the Yoruba Nation agitation including Prof. Banji Akintoye.</p><p>He alleged further that the judiciary system in Benin Republic is not effective and that is why Igboho has so far remained in custody since he was arrested and detained in the country on July 19, 2021, by operatives of Brigade Criminelle (Criminal Brigade) in Cotonou.</p><p>Naija News reports that Igboho has spent over 161 days in detention with no sign of his release on the horizon.</p><p>His spokesperson on Tuesday said only the Benin President, Patrice Talon has the owers to free Igboho but the Nigerian government wants him extradited to the country for trial.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday received the 2022 Appropriation Bill from the National Assembly.</p><p>Naija News recalls that the National Assembly had last week Tuesday and Wednesday passed the budget after raising the total estimates from the proposed N16.391tn to N17.126tn.</p><p>It also rained the oil benchmark from the proposed $57 per barrel to $62.</p><p>According to The PUNCH, a communication from the Clerk to the National Assembly, Ojo Amos, disclosed that NASS sent the budget to the presidency on Friday and it was received by the Office of the Chief of Staff to the President on Saturday.</p><p>The letter of transmission, with Reference Number NASS/CNA/37/Vol.1/35, was addressed to the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and titled ‘APPROPRIATION BILL, 2022.’</p><p>A former Minister of Aviation, Osita Chidoka has disagreed with the submission by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi who claimed the treasury that was handed over by the Goodluck Jonathan administration to the Muhammadu Buhari government in 2015 wasn’t enough to run Nigeria’s economy for three weeks.</p><p>Chidoka, therefore, called on the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government to stop the blame game and focus on governance.</p><p>He submitted that a foreign reserve of $28.6 billion was left by Jonathan which is verifyable on the website of the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as $5.6 billion Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas Limited dividends.</p><p>Also, the Jonathan administration left a total of $2.2 billion in the Excess Crude Account on May 29, 2015 according to him.</p><p>Chidoka, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) made the submission on Tuesday in response to claims by Amaechi when he appeared on Channels Television’s programme titled, ‘Hard Copy’ that the money left behind for the country by the former President, Goodluck Jonathan in 2015 was not enough to run the affairs of the country for three weeks.</p><p>Terrorists loyal to the Islamic State in West African Province (ISWAP) are planning to attack the Damboa and Chibok communities of Borno State.</p><p>The alarm was raised by some residents of the area who claimed they have noticed gathering similar to what obtains when the terrorists want to launch an attack.</p><p>Sources from Borno who spoke to The Cable on Tuesday said the insurgents are moving towards Gumsuri Litawa which is an area between Chibok and Damboa.</p><p>According to the sources, the movements have been observed since Christmas eve, December 24.</p><p>“When they gather like that, they start to infiltrate the towns and before you know it, they have launched the attack,” one of the residents said.</p><p>Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has denied a claim by the leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum, Edwin Clark, that he hates the people of Niger Delta and the region.</p><p>Naija News learned that Clark in an open letter to Obasanjo had claimed that the former President still has disdain and insincerity for the people of Niger Delta region.</p><p>Clark said Obasanjo’s comments that the oil found in the Niger Delta does not belong to the people of the region represents his continuous hate against Niger Delta.</p><p>Replying to the PANDEF leader in a letter dated December 28, Obasanjo said Clark was wrong for accusing him of having disdain for the people of Niger Delta.</p><p>In the letter titled “My response to the open letter by Clark”, Obasanjo said what Clark called an outburst is his way of getting people to attention.</p><p>Obasanjo stated that some of the words used by Clark to describe him are offensive and uncouth, asking the Ijaw leader to retract the letter.</p><p>The former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha has accused his successor, Governor Hope Uzodinma, of being behind unknown gunmen ravaging the state.</p><p>Naija News understands that the Senator representing Imo West made this claim on Tuesday in an interview with Channels TV.</p><p>According to Okorocha, “It appears to me as though the misery behind unknown gunmen has been unravelled by recent happenings.”</p><p>The former governor also noted that the unknown gunmen were a set of rogue police officers working without the consent of the police authorities but get their instructions from Mr Uzodinma and his Chief Security Officer.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspapers headlines for today.
