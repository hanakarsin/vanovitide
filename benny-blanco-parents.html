His parents are Sandra and Andrew Levin. Sandra works in the apparel business while Andrew works in an assisted living facility, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jewish Unpacked.</a></p><p>From time to time, Benny has talked about his parents in the media and online.</p><p>"Jewish mothers will never run out of things to worry about," he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> in 2013.</p><p>Then, he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Augustman</a> in 2021, "Ever since I was like a baby I was into music, I would always like bang on the pots and pans. My mom and dad were very into music, so they played me music very early on and my brother was also really into music so he would take me into records stores."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Meanwhile, the producer initially thought about being a rapper, but then, as he hilariously told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> in 2018, he figured out that “no one cares what a chubby Jewish kid from Virginia thinks."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Benny Blanco's Jewish ethnicity is a big part of his life.</h2><p>As you can tell, being Jewish is a big part of the under-the-radar star's identity. He often tweets <a href=#>about his Judaism</a>, mostly finding humor on the topic, but also, at times, waxing poetic on his religion.</p><p>"Being Jewish is a state of mind... not a religious group," Benny <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opined</a> in 2010 for example.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me w/o music is like a jew w/o alka seltzer</p>— benny blanco (@ItsBennyBlanco) <a href=#>October 11, 2009</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Benny has also delved into Jewish cooking — but that's not the only type of cuisine the <a href=#>cookbook author</a> has perfected.</p><p>Among his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">culinary endeavors</a> is cooking and, well, eating. In 2020, he launched a show with his fellow artist, <a href=#>Lil Dicky</a> called Matty and Benny Eat Out America.</p><p>Benny also published a cookbook called Open Wide. About the project, Benny explained in part on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, "I wrote this book to teach you how to throw the sickest dinner party."</p><p>He joked, "I'm literally driving to a dinner party right now with a bowl of marinated meat on my lap and kimchi pancakes on the dashboard while I write this."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>About what food means to Benny, he shared, "I’ve been told some of the finest stories over meals. I’ve laughed so hard I thought I was going to actually die. I’ve fallen in love, sometimes with the food, sometimes with the person across the table. I’ve cried in good ways, and I’ve cried in bad ways."</p><p>Finally, Benny said, "I hope you’ve been lucky enough to have all these same memories and then some. But if you haven’t, I can make you a promise. If you follow these three simple steps, it will all become a reality. Open this book. Open your heart. And open wide, baby."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7KvuthmmaWZnpi8brzAq5ynrKM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-voice-twist-cross-battles.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's Everything You Need to Know About the New &amp;quot;Twist&amp;quot; on 'The Voice' (SPOILERS)">&larr;
