However, she only learnt that her ex-husband had been diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly known as “multiple personality disorder”) after the divorce.

Speaking to<i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> CBS This Morning</a></i> about Christian's decision to venture into cheerleading, Herschel said:</p>“I didn’t know what that was. Then he’s, ‘Oh, no. People turning flips and all this stuff. Dance and all this.’ And I came out to see it. And I saw how athletic the kids were that was doing it. I was like, ‘Geez, I didn’t realize it was that big of a sport’ and I was proud that he was doing it.”<p class=align-left>Cindy DeAngelis Grossman is a remarkable entrepreneur and former partner to the famous football star Herschel Walker.
