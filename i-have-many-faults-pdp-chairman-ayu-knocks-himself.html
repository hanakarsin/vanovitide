We founded the party to access power and develop the country. And my historic task is to return the party to power. I won’t be Chairman forever. For now, my preoccupation is to return the Party to power. I did not come to steal. My public service record is there.</p><p>“I have been a leader of the National Assembly. I have been a minister many times. As a person, I have many faults, but stealing is not one of them. I am conscious of my place in history, and the NWC that I lead is guided by the twin principles of transparency and accountability,”&nbsp;Ayu said.</p><p>Ayu added: “You may be reading many things and expecting my reaction. If we don’t always talk, it is because we want to maintain and build cohesion in the party. We don’t want continuous altercations in the PDP Family. Our eyes are on the big picture i.e. winning the 2023 general elections.</p><p>“Therefore, let us not lose focus. Let us keep our eyes glued on the big picture. Everything else is secondary. We took office because there was crisis in the party. And we don’t want to keep moving from crisis to crisis. It’s not good for the party. We can’t be in perpetual crises, especially where the crisis is artificial.</p><p>“The NWC met and discussed the issue of Housing Allowance. It was unanimously agreed that no bribe or any form of illegality took place. A statement has since been issued to that effect. The matter has now been laid to rest.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49wZqJlmJbDpnnMmqWyZZaWwq3A0mannahdmLWitdGmmKdlka7CbrfNqJqkq12dtq6%2FxKWdaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./liz-woods-dating-90-day-fiance.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Liz Woods Dating? 90 Day Fiance Fans Want to Know">&larr;
