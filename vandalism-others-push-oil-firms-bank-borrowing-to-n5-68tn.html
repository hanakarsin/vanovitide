Total Energies and SPDC for example stopped production into the TNP pipeline while Agip Eni declare force majeure on their brass terminal.”</p><p>A petroleum engineer and oil and gas analyst, Bala Zaka, while speaking on the issue, listed vandalism and insecurity among the major concerns in the sector, describing them as the primary reasons for the high rate of borrowing among oil firms.</p><p>Zaka while speaking with Punch on Monday said vandalism and insecurity had increased the operating cost of oil and gas firms.</p><p>In a bid to offset the growing costs, he said companies in the sector had been forced to turn to financial institutions.</p><p>He said, “The operating cost of oil and gas firms, both those in the downstream and upstream sub-sectors, is very high now, particularly because of issues of vandalism and security.</p><p>“You will see that because of insecurity problems, many of these companies, both onshore and offshore; employ the services of heavy security personnel to safeguard their equipment. Sometimes even their staff has to be secured.</p><p>“This additional security costs a lot of money; this is affecting their bottom line and profit before tax. On the issue of vandalism, I have observed that a lot of these firms are being harassed by their host communities which is why improve their CSR and give back to these communities.”</p><p>He added, “Again, for companies who have joint-venture relationships with the government or the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation; there is what we call cash call. This is a situation where for every well the companies intend to explore, the Federal Government is supposed to contribute about 60 per cent of the cost of exploration, but most of the time they don’t. So these oil companies are forced to source for the 60 per cent from financial institutions.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5ByZq%2BZnpmurbXSpmSorJiav7R5z66qoWWfnrlussirpKxlkpa7rHnBqKmrp6eeu6h506hkp21da4W1uo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1204746-what-slay-social-media-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What does &amp;quot;slay&amp;quot; mean on social media?
