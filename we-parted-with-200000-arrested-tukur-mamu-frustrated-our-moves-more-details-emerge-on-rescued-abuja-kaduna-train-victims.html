We were able to go into the bush and bring back the remaining of our family members.</p><h2>Mamu Is A Betrayer</h2><p>Speaking further, the committee member expressed delight that Mamu has been arrested, claiming that the self-acclaimed negotiator attempted to derail the entire process.</p><p>“We achieved this not through somebody who betrayed the committee and the government, I am talking about the person of Tukur Mamu who did everything within his reach to thwart the efforts of the government for his own interest. As we all know, he is in the hands of the government now. But we thank God, all our family members are back now.</p><p>“The bandits never asked for money ab-initio, Tukur Mamu introduced money into the whole thing and derailed the process and kept everybody for the past six months.</p><p>“We parted away with about 200,000 US Dollars. Thank God the CDS took it upon himself and put in place a committee that never asked a kobo. Every sacrifice being done so far has been personal towards ensuring the release of the victims.</p><h2>Committee Members Deserve National Honours</h2><p>He said members of the committee that secured the release of the victims deserve to be praised and recognized for their patriotic efforts and sacrifices.</p><p>He urged the security agents to find ways of deploying dialogue in dealing with the insecurity plaguing the nation.</p><p>“In the committee, I can assure you that I worked with credible people of the highest order. If I have my way, all of them would be given national honours. We risked our lives, went to the bush, we slept there in the bush.</p><p>“We heard the complaints of those people (the terrorists), even though we knew what they have done is wrong, but we had to engage them.</p><p>“Going forward, our security agencies must synergise their operations and the government should open more room for further engagements,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49wZrCdXaWus8DEnWSwoaSdenN8j2lnaWWRp7%2Bmv9Oem2aspaDCs3nMmqSuZZanwrTA0ZqrnpxdpMKzecyorZ6rXaK8s7GMnZytmZmhwG6xzJ6poJ1dpLtuvsSsmq6dlGKuo8HJmmSkmZSqu6J506uYoqZdq7akwMimqmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ghosts-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ghosts - Cast, Ages, Trivia">&larr;
