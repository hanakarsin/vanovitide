The show was set to follow Vicki and her friends as they gave viewers an inside look on what it's like in the real-life OC. Behind the Gates was later renamed <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Orange County</a> and became the beginning of the ever-popular Real Housewives franchise.</p><p>Behind the Gates was later renamed The Real Housewives of Orange County and followed Vicki and her family for its first 14 seasons</p><p>The Housewives OG wisely used her time on the show, sharing incredible taglines and other quotable moments like the fan-favorite "Whoop it up." Vicki also introduced the world to <a href=#>Brooks Ayers</a>, a fact many fans haven't forgiven her for.</p><p>While her time on RHOC has shifted over the years, her legacy as one of its originals remains. More importantly, Vicki reportedly still has a nice nest egg to sit on as she focuses on other projects.</p><p>So, what is the reality TV star's net worth? Let's explore!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Vicki Gunvalson's net worth?</h2><p>Vicki may have put her orange down, but the Bravolebrity apparently has plenty of cheese. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, she's worth $7 million, most of which comes from her time on the show and her entrepreneurial efforts. Before reality TV, the Chicago native began her career in insurance sales and as a financial advisor in 1991. Her passion for insurance came after a friend advised her to get a life insurance policy and after her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at age 59.</p><p>"Vicki learned the true importance of insurance after her father was diagnosed with Alzheimerâ€™s disease at the young age of 59 without having any long term care insurance," Coto's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> read. "After experiencing the financial toll this took on the family, she decided to focus on helping others in planning for the unplanned."</p><p>She eventually became an expert in her field and launched her business, Coto Insurance, in 2007. The company offers assistance with various types of insurance, including life, dental, and disability coverage. When Vicki isn't being a girl boss in her California office, she's lending her "isms" to her and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Gray Snow</a>'s podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">My Friend My Soulmate My Podcast</a>. She and current OC star <a href=#>Shannon Storms Beador</a> have also been on the road for their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">live shows</a> after they and Tamra Judge disbanded their trio, <a href=#>Tres Amigas</a>.</p><p class="sc-ktvXtq dPyThM"><span>Vicki Gunvalson</span></p><p class="sc-fxFQrc gpgOkp">Reality TV Star, CEO of Coto Insurance, Podcast host</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $7 Million</p><p>Vicki Gunvalson is a reality TV personality best known for being one of the inaugural cast members of The Real Housewives of Orange County.

However, she's still collecting a cute coin from her <a href=#>guest appearances</a> on RHOC. though it's likely not what she earned as a full-time wife.</p><p>Before her exit from RHOC in 2020, she reportedly earned $500,000 a season.
