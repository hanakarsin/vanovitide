It further confirms our Party’s position that the Tinubu-led APC government is a cesspit of corruption; a haven for thieves and treasury looters.</p><p>“Nigerians were shocked by reports of how Betta Edu and the suspended National Coordinator of NSIPA, Halima Shehu allegedly engaged in brazen looting of billions of Naira while Nigerians who the funds are meant for are deprived and abandoned to excruciating hardship and misery.</p><p>“Equally disheartening is the reports of how Betta Edu allegedly directed the transfer of the N585.2 million NSIPA money into the private account of one of her fronts in clear violation of Chapter 7, Section 713 of Nigeria’s Financial Regulations, 2009 which expressly prohibits the payment of public money into a private account.</p><p>“For emphasis, Section 713 of Nigeria’s Financial Regulations, 2009 provides that “Personal money shall in no circumstances be paid into a government bank account, nor shall any public money be paid into a private bank account. An officer who pays public money into a private account is deemed to have done so with a fraudulent intention”.</p><p>“The apparent fraudulent intention by Betta Edu in diverting public funds into a private account; an action which was appropriately declared illegal by the Accountant General of the Federation, Oluwatoyin Madein, is consistent with APC’s character and proclivity for plundering of public resources.</p><p>“The lack of remorse by the Minister especially in her lame attempt to justify the illegal diversion of funds meant for poor Nigerians is also consistent with the insensitivity, heartlessness, impunity and criminal audacity inherent in the APC administration.</p><p>“A very disturbing information in the public domain indicates that the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs is allegedly working with two prominent APC officials in the Presidency and the National Assembly, who are alleged to be using Ministers and other officials of government to divert billions of naira to personal accounts.</p><p>“Additional information reveals that there are moves to use the suspended National Coordinator of NSIPA, Halima Shehu as a scapegoat so as to sweep the involvement of the Minister and the said APC leaders under the carpet.</p><p>“What Nigerians demand of President Tinubu at the moment is to demonstrate commitment to the fight against corruption by immediately sacking Betta Edu, hand her over for investigation, prosecution and take steps to recover the stolen N44 billion and channel the fund recovered towards the wellbeing of Nigerians.</p><p>“The PDP also demands that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) @officialEFCC immediately invite Betta Edu for questioning and take further steps to commence a system-wide investigation into the alleged large-scale corruption and treasury looting pervading in Ministries, Agencies and Departments (MDAs) under the APC administration.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls a document that has circulated widely and bears Edu’s signature, addressed to the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, which <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>details instructions</a></strong> from the Minister to disburse N585,198,500.00 to an individual named Oniyelu Bridget.</p><p>It was gathered that the document also indicated that the disbursement of the N585.198 million grant, designated for vulnerable groups in Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Ogun, and Lagos states, was deposited into Oniyelu’s account.</p><p>The Minister has however denied any wrongdoing, saying the reports about her mismanaging public funds are <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>targeted</a></strong> at tarnishing her image.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye49wZqKsXZ7AbsDRmp6im12ptaLAjLKmrmWUnsOmvtOem2aln6OyunnMnpinrF2bvLN506GcZqifpL9uvMOpZJ2dnZa7pb%2BMrJico12ks26uxK2rmmWVmcJuu9WeqWaZnKGyqLHDZp2rmaWZfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./adeleke-moves-into-osun-govt-house-16-months-after-swearing-in.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adeleke Moves Into Osun Govt House 16 Months After Swearing-In">&larr;
