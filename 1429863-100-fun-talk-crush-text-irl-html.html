Our article will, hopefully, help you start a pleasant chat with that special someone.</p><h2>Things to talk about with your crush: a complete guide</h2><p class=align-left>We are going to share some useful advice, which will help you learn what to talk about with your crush. Before getting anxious, remember - how you present yourself in front of them is more important than what you actually talk about.</p><h3>What can I talk about with my crush?</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d934ec16b5520942.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ exciting things to do when bored at home</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Here are some topics to talk about with your crush in person or over text. You should keep in mind that the most important thing is to be confident.</p><h4>Music</h4><p class=align-left>Discussing favourite songs always causes people to bond because it is quite likely that they either have a similar taste or can share their picks with each other. Who knows - maybe you can even subtly <a href=#>confess your feelings</a> through <a href=#>music</a>.</p><h4>Fashion</h4><p class=align-left>You can start by complimenting their fashion sense, and perhaps, a conversation will evolve towards talking about places where they like to buy their clothes.</p><h4>Sports</h4><p class=align-left>A lot of people enjoy <a href=#>sport</a>s. Try to figure out which sport your crush likes and their favourite team.</p><h4>Movies</h4><p class=align-left>Asking about your crush's favourite movie can result in a pleasant discussion.</p><h4>TV shows</h4><p class=align-left>Which show is <a href=#>your crush</a> binging right now? Try to casually ask for their recommendations.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f201313e463a0d71.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best examples of creative hobbies for women</span></p></a><h4>Travelling</h4><p class=align-left>Most people enjoy travelling and seeing new places. You can ask about the most enjoyable trip they have been to or their dream trip.</p><h4>Hobbies</h4><p class=align-left>Asking about your crush's hobbies could give you a brief idea about their personality.</p><h4>Pets</h4><p class=align-left>A lot of people either have a pet, have had one in the past, or want to have one. You can learn more about what kind of animals your crush likes - dogs, cats, or maybe some other sweet little creatures.</p><h4>Jokes</h4><p class=align-left>You could showcase your sense of humour and make your crush laugh by making some funny jokes.</p><h4>Studies or work</h4><p class=align-left>If your crush is a fellow student or coworker, it is always a good idea to bond over something related to studies or work.</p><h3>What are things to talk about with your crush over text?</h3><p class=align-left>How can I flirt with my crush? If you know the person rather well, you can be a little flirty with them over text.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/15425c13fe724d0b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a conversation with a girl: Simple tips to get you started</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Here are some examples of questions to ask <a href=#>your crush</a> while texting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d934ec16b5520942.jpg><ul><li>Could you tell me something about yourself that you have never told anyone?</li><li>What is the best pickup line you have ever heard?</li><li>What would be the best way for a person to let you know they like you?</li><li>What is the most romantic thing you have ever done?</li><li>How long have you been single?</li><li>What qualities do you find attractive in a person?</li><li>If I called you late at night, would you answer?</li><li>Is there anything you want to know about me?</li><li>How do you know when you are in love with someone?</li><li>What is the best part about being in a relationship for you?</li><li>Do you like cuddling?</li><li>What are the cutest things you would do for a date?</li><li>Have you ever used dating apps?</li><li>What is the biggest turn on for you in a person?</li><li>Do you have a crush on any fictional characters?</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/df75a824eec61b9f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best topics to talk about with your partner</span></p></a><h3>Casual conversation starters with your crush</h3><p class=align-left>If you would like to know how to start a conversation with your crush, you are probably determined to make the first step.</p><p class=align-left>There is a lot of stuff to talk about with your crush, and here, you can find some of the most common yet meaningful conversation starters that you can use either in person or over text.</p><ul><li>What is your favourite hobby?</li><li>Do you have any pets?</li><li>Which pizza topping do you like the most?</li><li>What was your dream job as a kid?</li><li>Why did you get your name?
