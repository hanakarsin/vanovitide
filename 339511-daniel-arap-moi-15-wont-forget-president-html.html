He might be despised and admired in equal measure for his style of leadership, but one thing that cannot be disputed is that we won’t be forgetting him anytime soon. He rose into the presidency after the death of Jomo Kenyatta, who was the first president of the country. Despite opposition from key political figures, Moi managed to take over. Something that many people never imagined is that Moi could ever hand over power, but he did so after a second term under the new constitution, which had a limit of two terms for a president.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/c914af859a767122.jpeg><p class=align-left>Many Kenyans grew up not knowing the difference between the name Moi and the president. To most, ‘Moi’ and ‘president’ were the same thing. After handing power in 2002, the former president retreated to a quiet life and only started making headlines again when he began having health issues. As Kenyans mourn his death, there are many things to remember about the former head of state.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4bdb273e8d2aba1a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenya Kwanza a ‘Con Scheme’ that Will End in Premium Tears for ‘small’ Parties</span></p></a><h2>Things we won’t forget about Daniel Arap Moi</h2><p class=align-left>Here are some of the things we won’t forget about the former president:</p><h3>1. KANU chairman</h3><p class=align-left>Millennials might be wondering, "how did Moi become president?" He ascended into leadership after the death of Mzee Kenyatta while still in office. The Kenya African National Union party has been in leadership for almost 40 years, and Moi was the man at the helm for more than half of that time. That is why the KANU party will always be identified with the late president.</p><p class=align-left>Moi strengthened the party, ensuring it had members from every corner of the country. With his retirement, the party also became weak as Moi’s chosen successor Uhuru Kenyatta failed to clinch the top seat using the KANU ticket in 2002. KANU is famously remembered for the cockerel as part of its symbol.</p><h3>2. Nyayo milk</h3><p class=align-left>Maziwa ya Nyayo was an initiative by the late president Moi to increase school attendance through the issuance of free milk to school-going children. It is one of the things Daniel Moi will staunchly be remembered for. The milk scheme came into existence in 1979 and ensured the success of several education reforms, including the introduction of the 8-4-4 system.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0b93b7dadfa82e00.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>William Ruto Owes Kenyans Apology for Years of Pay with No Work Done</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The milk was delivered to all primary schools in the country, and people often wonder how he managed to do it and still ensure the economy remained stable. To date, it remains one of the greatest Daniel Arap Moi achievements.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4bdb273e8d2aba1a.jpeg><h3>3. Love for sports</h3><p class=align-left>President Moi loved sports more than the other presidents who have ruled Kenya. Under Moi’s leadership, Nyayo and Kasarani stadia were built. Even more impressive is the fact that Moi used to attend Harambee Stars matches when they used to play at home. He would also support the national team and other clubs financially so that they would focus on playing the beautiful game.</p><h3>4. Fimbo ya Nyayo</h3><p class=align-left>The former president had a ‘rungu’ which he never left behind. While Jomo Kenyatta’s symbol of authority was a fly-whisk, Moi carried with him a baton for the same purpose. The baton was made of ivory and gold.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/10cb35f4866784f6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Explained: Why Kenyans Should Not Elect William Ruto to Succeed Uhuru Kenyatta</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The significance of the baton was so immense that when it once broke while the president was about to leave <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Los Angeles for Melbourne</a>, calls had to be made for another rungu to be flown from Kenya.</p><h3>5. Music enthusiast</h3><p class=align-left>President Moi loved music, and anywhere he went would be choirs waiting to entertain him. He would also welcome school children to the statehouse to sing for him something that has become a culture even with the presidents who came after him. He loved hymns a lot to the extent of choosing the particular hymn he wanted to theme his send-off.</p><p class=align-left>The former president used a lot of resources to promote the music industry in the country. Many of the songs composed during the reign of Daniel Moi had patriotic ideologies that united Kenyans and brought a sense of nationhood.</p><h3>6. 1982 coup attempt and Nyayo House torture chambers</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2cefe427d8c6bfd2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amason Kingi Exudes Confidence William Ruto Will Solve Land Issues in Coast: "The Journey Has Started"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The darker spells of Mzee Moi’s presidency are traced back to a 1982 failed coup. The president would have been overthrown had it not been for a loyal military. A group of soldiers from the Kenya Air Force were behind the plot, and most of them would end facing the full wrath of president Moi.</p><p class=align-left>It gave birth to the Nyayo House torture chambers. Anyone who was believed to threaten national security or challenged Moi’s grip on power would find himself here, and it was not pleasant.</p><h3>7. One-party rule</h3><p class=align-left>President Daniel Moi believed that multiparty democracies were never meant for Africa. Due to the challenge of different ethnicities, Moi believed that a single party rule was the way forward. Fierce critics included Raila Odinga and Koigi Wamwere, among others who agitated for multiparty democracy.</p><p class=align-left>Eventually, Moi would bow to pressure and agree to multiparty politics in the country, but his party remained in power for several years until his retirement.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2d6e54ccb152eb58.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>William Ruto Unashamedly Riding on Uhuru's Legacy Projects to Popularise His Punctured Bid</span></p></a><h3>8. Empowering girls through education</h3><p class=align-left>There is no doubt that Moi was an educationist partly because he was a teacher before becoming a politician. His notable contribution in the education sector is felt more by girls. During his presidency, Moi started many schools, and most of them are girls’ schools.</p><p class=align-left>It is a remarkable accomplishment considering that many communities were not taking girls to school at the time. The president championed for the education of girls, thus offering equal opportunity to millions of Kenyans. Many of the schools named after Moi are girls’ schools, and it is anyone’s guess that those schools were started by the former president.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0b93b7dadfa82e00.jpeg><h3>9. The assassination of Robert Ouko</h3><p class=align-left>Kenya has had its fair share of assassinations, but Robert Ouko’s is one of those that will forever be remembered. Hezekiah Oyugi, who was the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Nicholas Biwott</a>, who was Kenya’s Minister of Energy at the time of Dr. Robert Ouko’s murder are allegedly accused as the ones behind the assassination. Although President Moi was never directly implicated, many believe that his government had a hand in the incidence.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1d83d2e8e2b0d9ff.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kitale Comedian Who's Sought Military Job Since 2013 Walks 47 Kilometres to Mark KDF Day 2021</span></p></a><h3>10. Loved to read the Bible</h3><p class=align-left>Many people have revealed that former president Moi was a very prayerful person, and he read his Bible every morning. Furthermore, Moi attended church every Sunday in various parts of the country. He would also donate considerable sums to churches, and some have claimed that he only gave money that was earned from his farm.</p><p class=align-left>His generosity did not go unnoticed, as many people would flock statehouse to receive handouts.</p><h3>11. Regional peacemaker</h3><p class=align-left>Daniel Moi’s reign as president foresaw a period in which the country was relatively stable. The president went beyond the borders of the country to ensure there was peace in the region and Africa at large. It was a time when there was chaos in neighboring countries such as Uganda, Somalia, and Sudan, among others.</p><p class=align-left>He played a central role in reviving the East African Community, which had collapsed in 1977. Moi was always at the forefront in sending Kenyan soldiers to countries that needed peace-keeping. Daniel Arap Moi biography cannot be written without mentioning these achievements.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b893d744b41f0d80.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Governor Lonyangapuo Registers New Party after Ditching Gideon Moi's KANU</span></p></a><h3>12. Endorsing Uhuru Kenyatta in 2002</h3><p class=align-left>KANU had been in power for 39 years, and Moi was retiring from politics. Naturally, he thought of hand-picking a successor to lead the party and probably take over as president as well. The person selected by President Moi was Uhuru Kenyatta, the current president of Kenya.</p><p class=align-left>It was a surprise move considering some political heavyweights such as Raila, Saitoti, and Mudavadi were all eyeing that endorsement and Uhuru was not so much of a prominent figure back then. Uhuru flopped in the 2002 elections and conceded defeat to Mwai Kibaki.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/9e58c24b1e891dc5.jpeg><h3>13. Punctuality</h3><p class=align-left>There is a notion that politicians are never punctual because they always have a lot of engagements. That is not president Moi. He has been described as a workaholic who used to wake up very early. He would begin his appointments as early as 7:30 in the morning. Whenever he said he would attend a function at a stipulated time, he would arrive at the said time and would leave for another meeting when one ended.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/00fb5635ba9aa2b2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan John Gatambia Irungu Elected Student’s President in The University of The District of Columbia</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He is probably the president who visited more places in this country compared to the other three. Daniel Arap Moi previous offices might have shaped him to be the man he became. For instance, one of the values of a teacher should be punctuality.</p><h3>14. Environmental conservation</h3><p class=align-left>President Moi was a vocal advocate for the conservation of the environment. He is remembered for advocating people to plant two trees whenever they cut one. Cut one tree, and plant two is among the most remembered Daniel Arap Moi quotes.</p><p class=align-left>The president would mobilize people to participate in tree planting exercises as well as constructing gabions along slopes. His efforts in environmental projects did not go unnoticed as he received an award by UNEP.</p><h3>15. Seeking forgiveness</h3><p class=align-left>He might have ruled with an iron fist, but when he was retiring Moi showed a side of him, many people did not know. The former president openly apologized to those he had wronged and forgave those who had wronged him. It was an essential lesson that there are no permanent enemies in politics and that sometimes leaders may make tough choices, but that is just the job.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c39e4b47c7b3dc41.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Charles Njonjo: 10 facts that will blow your mind</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Daniel Arap Moi will probably go in history as the longest-serving president this country ever had and will ever have. The former president was in power for more than three decades, sparking a lot of memories from Kenyans. First, he came into power after the death of the then president Jomo Kenyatta. He then led the country into a single-party state and back to a multiparty system. Moi also lived through an attempted coup and yet retained power. It is safe to say then that although he has taken his final bow, President Moi earned the title “professor of politics” in every sense of the phrase.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Robert Mugabe: 10 things we won't forget about the former Zimbabwe president</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FknJsamldma6vtcSlZJqqkaV6rrvIZmhuZaeku7V5xaipoJ2kYr2zsdKim56mpGO1tbnL</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./just-in-lalong-akeredolu-apc-govs-meet-in-abuja.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lalong, Akeredolu, APC Govs Meet In Abuja">&larr;
