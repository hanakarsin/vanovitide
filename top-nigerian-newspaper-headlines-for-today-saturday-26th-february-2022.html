The Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ bumbling of its responsibility to these Nigerians in the Diaspora was laid bare when they issued a statement expressing surprise over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, its southern neighbour. Before Abuja woke from its slumber to express surprise over what was imminent, serious nations of the world had issued advisories and evacuated their citizens to safety. While reporting this national shame yesterday, CNN stated that while other governments were busy evacuating their citizens from war-torn Ukraine, Nigerian students said they’ve been basically told by their embassy in Kyiv that: “You’re on your own”!</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday signed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 into law.</p><p>The development followed series of calls by stakeholders that the bill should be signed into law before the 2023 general elections.</p><p>A coalition of civil society organisations had as well staged a protest to compel the president to assent to the amended document.</p><p>Naija News reports that the signing ceremony took place today inside the Council Chambers of the Presidential Villa, Abuja at about 12:30 pm.</p><p>The&nbsp;Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government on Friday summoned the Ambassadors of Russia and Ukraine to Nigeria, Alexei Shebarshin and Kirdoda Valerii.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that the government summoned the duo over the evacuation of Nigerians from both countries.</p><p>This was made known by the Minister of Foreign Affairs,&nbsp;Geoffrey Onyeama, who met with the envoys behind closed doors.</p><p>Speaking on his meeting with the Russian Ambassador, Onyeama said he told Shebarshin that the Government of Nigeria could not condone as a country, the violation of the territorial integrity of a United Nations member state</p><p>Following the&nbsp;signing of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law&nbsp;on Friday by President Muhammadu Buhari, ten major highlights of the law have been spotted.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that the signing was done at the Council Chambers of the Presidential Villa, Abuja at about 12:30 pm after several postponements and rejections.</p><p>The Nigerian leader assented to the bill in the presence of the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC,&nbsp;Mahmood Yakubu;&nbsp;President of the Senate,&nbsp;Ahmed Lawan,&nbsp;Speaker, House of Representatives,&nbsp;Femi Gbajabiamila.</p><p>The 2022 Electoral Amendment Bill, which is an amendment to the 2010 Electoral Act, would help strengthen the country’s electoral process and deepen Nigeria’s democracy.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari has called on the National Assembly to take notice of a section of the electoral bill signed into law on Friday for amendment.</p><p>The President&nbsp;in his speech&nbsp;during the signing of the bill at the council chamber of the Aso Rock Villa in Abuja told the legislators that a section of the bill contravenes the provision of the constitution.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports President Buhari wants the portion of the bill which bans serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party expunged.</p><p>He observed that the part contravenes the provision in the country’s constitution which already states that such political office holders should resign, withdraw or retire at least 30 days before the date of the election.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, 25th February ended months of speculations and waiting when he signed the electoral act amendment bill 2022 into law.</p><p>As earlier reported by&nbsp;Naija News, the signing was done&nbsp;at a brief ceremony&nbsp;that took place inside the Council Chambers of the Presidential Villa, Abuja at about 12:30 pm.</p><p>The bill was signed after the review and subsequent transmission to the President by the National Assembly.</p><p>Among the top government officials present to witness the signing ceremony were Senate President Ahmad Lawan, INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, and many others.</p><p>The pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the Electoral Bill 2022 may lead at least four of his ministers to resignation.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that President Buhari is expected to sign the re-worked&nbsp;Electoral Act Amendment Bill&nbsp;on Friday, February 25.</p><p>A source close to the Presidency had told Channels Television earlier that the bill transmitted to the Nigerian leader by the National Assembly on January 31 will be signed into law before 1 pm today.</p><p>However, if accomplished, at least four ministers and several personalities heading Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) may be affected as the bill provides that it is mandatory for political appointees who want to run for office in 2023 must resign first.</p><p>A Lagos High Court sitting in Ikeja, has sentenced notorious kidnapper, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike, popularly known as&nbsp;Evans, and two others to life imprisonment.</p><p>Justice Hakeem Oshodi on Friday, sentenced Evans and his co-defendants, Uchenna Amadi and Okuchuwkwu Nwachukwu&nbsp;after&nbsp;convicting them on two counts of conspiracy and kidnapping of Duru.</p><p>The judge who stated that the video evidence tendered against Evans proved that he was guilty said,&nbsp;“He was seen freely laughing and willingly answered questions. A close look at his body shows no sign of torture. He did not look unkempt. He is seen laughing even when he was told that he must be a rich kidnapper.</p><p>“He showed no remorse in the dock and tried to lie his way out of the crimes despite the video evidence.”</p><p>The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC),&nbsp;Asiwaju Bola Tinubu&nbsp;on Friday paid a visit to the Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that the former Lagos governor who visit the traditional ruler in continuation of his consultation was received by a massive crowd in Osogbo, the Osun State capital.</p><p>Tinubu, who had in January declared his presidential ambition after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari,&nbsp;was joined by Osun Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola and other supporters.</p><p>Commissioner for Regional Integration and Special Duties, Olalekan Badmus, led other commissioners in the State to welcome Tinubu, Oyetola and their entourage to the palace, The Nation reports.</p><p>Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has effected a major redeployment of its staff.</p><p>INEC&nbsp;in a statement by the chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee,&nbsp;Barr. Festus Okoye&nbsp;said a total of 186 staff members are affected by the shake-up.</p><p>He pointed out that all the affected staff members are either serving in their states of origin or have served for between 10 and 32 years in the same state which is not too suitable for the kind of sensitive assignments they are involved in.</p><p>Naija News reports the redeployed staff are to resume at their new places of assignment no later than Wednesday, March 9, 2022.</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
