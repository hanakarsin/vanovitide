The idea was for the two parents to contribute towards their kid’s education fund.</p>“She told me that I needed to do that so that just in case anything happened, the kids would still be covered,” Leila recalled, adding that this looked harmless to her.“After all this was for our common interest, which was our children. So I carried the documents home, explained to Mr. Man (her husband) that I had decided to take academic policies for the boys and that I wanted him to be a holder on one.” “He was okay with being a holder, but quickly distanced himself from paying the premiums, he said that since this was my idea, he was not going to commit.” She adds. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/614cac308c24ccd8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Woman Accused of Dumping Lover, Stealing from Him 3 Weeks to Wedding Says They Parted Ways Peacefully</span></p></a><p class=align-left>So the husband signed to be the policyholder of the older boy but did not agree to contribute towards the kitty. This left Leila to source for funds to remit into the policies as per her agreement with the insurance.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Don't miss trending Kenyan news.

At some point the policies almost lapsed due to the huge arrears, I walked to the office and my agent advised me to concentrate on the older boy's policy since he was in upper primary,” she recalled.<p class=align-left>All this time, the husband never bothered to find out how the policies were running and if she needed any help.</p>“This however did not bother me as I had decided to secure the future of our children,” she told TUKO.co.ke. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3b1c028f22630cb3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Au’qwon Turner: Son Sacrifices Coveted Chance to Join Navy by Choosing to Donate Liver to Ailing Mum</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Things went well until a time when she and her husband could no longer be together as the relationship got seriously strained.</p>“The inevitable happened and we parted ways,” she said.<p class=align-left>Remembering she had included her now ex-husband as a policyholder, she went to her insurance agency to find out if that would affect her sons’ covers. She had been contributing monthly premiums of KSh 5130 for each son’s policy.</p>“I was told not to worry but just continue paying, that when the policy gets to partial maturity, they will simply do a cheque to school. I was told that it was a bit late to change it back to my name because it had paid for many years and was almost getting to partial maturity.”<p class=align-left>This comforted Leila and she continued to service the two policies. Upon maturity, Leila was set to get partial payouts of KSh 69,000 yearly from the year 2018 to 2022 then in in 2023 she would get the total sum assured of KSh 455,450 for her son’s higher education.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6fe0c98034114b61.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nairobi Woman Narrates Finding Her Stolen Child 9 Days after Nanny Attempted to Sell Her in Uganda</span></p></a>“I was okay with this explanation, according to me, though separated, we had a common interest and I didn't imagine that someone could target his son's fee,” Leila said, adding that in 2008 when her son was ready to join high school, she went back to the insurance agency to check on the policy.<h2><strong>Account drained</strong></h2><p class=align-left>At the insurance, she was required to bring over her husband to sign the handover of the policy to her because she had been the one paying.</p>“He did not resist the handing over and I even asked the lady agent to just do a cheque of the whole amount to the school, to which she agreed. But she had to call the head office to get started on the processing of the fund. The shock was on me! My ex-husband had already withdrawn the money two weeks back!” Leila said. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/aa28ab6b82c2d595.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mother Regrets Saying No to COVID-19 Vaccine after Daughter is Hospitalised with Virus</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She was crushed. She did not know how to face her son who was now waiting for her at the reception area, and tell him that there was no school fee.</p>“I cried a river. I was told by the insurance that a policyholder has all rights to the policy and there was nothing they could do since the money had already been put in his account. Mr. Man was there, not moved at all. To him, there was nothing wrong with what he had done.” she added.<p class=align-left>Leila had to think fast and find a way to ensure her son is admitted into the school.</p><p class=align-left>However, for the second son’s cover, Leila was advised to go back to the office in June, just about time for the maturity of the second one.</p>“I purposed to focus on June like we had been told by the insurance hoping that at least second partial maturity and the other monies could be recovered.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7fe46d2d0354e2ec.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nyamira: Mother of Twins Gives Birth to Triplets, Appeals for Help to Raise Newborns</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But another shock was awaiting. Her husband had gone back to the insurance agency in March 2019 and took a loan against the policy.</p><p class=align-left>He had all the rights to the policy, he even removed Leila as “The payer” and as the “next of kin” and replaced her with his sister.</p>“Two weeks later I was called to the office to be informed about this and I felt so vulnerable. Why did the insurance allow him to take the loan yet this had been marked as a disputed policy? I asked all these questions but was told that the holder has all the rights to the policy. My insurance company let me down!” “That's how I lost my money which I had saved for 13 years and was meant for a very noble cause. Nilibaki tu na receipts.
