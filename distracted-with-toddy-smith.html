He has currently amassed millions of followers on his social media platforms, and he's not slowing down any time soon. Between his clothing brand <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gothic Mochas</a>, his cannabis company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Happy Face</a>, and his solo music work, he's made himself a multi-hyphenate icon.</p><p>Distractify chatted with Toddy to learn about his desert-island necessities, his dream collab, and more.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">If you were to get a tattoo right now, what would you get?</h2><p><strong>TS:</strong> Channing Tatum. His face. If there‚Äôs one thing about me, I love Channing Tatum ‚Äî he‚Äôs so funny. You see him randomly, like cameos in movies. He‚Äôs in one scene in Bullet Train and it‚Äôs so funny.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What is your current most-used emoji?</h2><p><strong>TS:</strong> The covering the face with eyes (ü´£) It used to be the one with the explosion of the head, but now it‚Äôs the one where he‚Äôs peeping [through his fingers]. It‚Äôs so funny.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What is the best fan interaction you‚Äôve ever had?</h2><p><strong>TS:</strong> I think last week, I was kind of drunk ‚Äî I was out, and this girl read my body language and aura. Like, I don't know if she was f--king with me or not. But, like, she's telling me this vision she had for me and was really in awe of it, and it was super strange. She was, like, reading my energy. Stuff like that. And she's Australian. I was like, 'Are you faking an accent?' ... So yeah, that's the most recent one.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@todderic</span></figure><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What was the first concert you attended?</h2><p><strong>TS:</strong> The Offspring. It was my 13th birthday. My parents were going to just allow me to bring one friend, but I had a couple of best friends and two cousins who were like my best friends, so they brought all of them. And it was f--king ‚Äî oh my god. The opening was crazy ... just, like, loud drum solos in the beginning. That was the first time I cussed in front of my parents. Their song, I think, was called ‚ÄúBad Habit.‚Äù They were like, "You can do it," so I was yelling at the top of my lungs a lot of cuss words.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What‚Äôs your favorite color?</h2><p><strong>TS: </strong>Purple. Sometimes it switches to certain shades of blue, but yeah, purple.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What is the best meal you‚Äôve ever had?</h2><p><strong>TS:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonah‚Äôs Kabob</a>. Definitely Jonah‚Äôs Kabob. Actually, this smoothie [in my hand]. I wanted to jump in this smoothie this morning. It‚Äôs from Playa Bowls. I was craving a smoothie, and I just wanted to bathe in it. [It has] blueberries, strawberries, bananas, dates, granola ... for some protein.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Who‚Äôs your current celebrity crush?</h2><p><strong>TS:</strong> Ryan Gosling.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@todderic; GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Shout out one of your favorite fellow creators.</h2><p><strong>TS:</strong> I‚Äôm going to go with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Nash</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Sire</a>.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Tell us about your dream collaboration.</h2><p><strong>TS:</strong> My dream collaboration now would be with A24. It would be a thriller. Have you seen Minari? [It's] a very heartwarming, nice story about a Korean family moving to the U.S. So they do make non-thrillers ... I just think an A24 thriller would be really cool.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What‚Äôs your go-to karaoke song?</h2><p><strong>TS: </strong>‚ÄúSemi-Charmed Life‚Äù by Third Eye Blind.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Share your top three necessities if you were trapped on a deserted island.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: unsplash; Instagram/@jonahskabob</span></figure><p><strong>TS:</strong> Rum, flint, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonah‚Äôs Kabob</a>. Everything you need!</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">If you couldn‚Äôt be a content creator, what would your dream job be?</h2><p><strong>TS: </strong>Firefighter. I went to school to be a firefighter before I moved to L.A. I did a couple of semesters at Santa Ana ‚Äî shout out Santa Ana!</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What‚Äôs your No. 1 distraction?</h2><p><strong>TS:</strong> Can I say phone? I guess my phone, but that‚Äôs kind of a lame answer ... Recently it‚Äôs been Twitter, to see who‚Äôs trending. Oh! You know what is distracting? My algorithm on Instagram. It‚Äôs a lot of stretching, because I‚Äôve been trying to stretch my hips and my back. And my whole algorithm is just people stretching. But yeah, I think it‚Äôs Twitter. F--k, it‚Äôs so lame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0wNGamq2dlGLEqsDHZquonJSuerS5yK2f</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1417747-breaking-president-buhari-appoints-new-chief-army-staff-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Farouk Yahaya: President Buhari Appoints New Chief of Army Staff">&larr;
