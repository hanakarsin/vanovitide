Once you hear their voice tag on a song, the song don blow. So, I thought that [I would blow].</p><p>“So when Fireboy come blow, I was like, ‘Eh! Fireboy blow before me? God, me I still dey…’ And all those times, God was teaching me that it’s not about my talent but by his grace.</p><p>“Oxlade too. I mean, before Oxlade blew, na me… Eh God! Oxlade was in my show in 2018. I also brought Davido and Mayorkun for the song. I had a song with Davido and Mayorkun in 2018. I thought that the song would blow me.</p><p>“I would post Oxlade on my social media pages and urge fans to watch out for him. And he would come to my DM to appreciate me. Then he just blew before me. I was like, ‘God, what is going on?’</p><p>“Na Oxlade and Fireboy blow na im pain me pass. No be say pain but it triggered me. I am happy that they blew at the point they blew but these are people that I was in the industry before them. I was like, ‘God, what is going on?’ So, it was so painful for me. It was frustrating. I would cry. I would struggle with God.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FpZqJlp5bAbrLRrqqtqpGpsqV51qGcp2WfrbmisMRmnaKqlZe8unnDpqNmn5Geu6awjKyrmqqUpLpursSfpqudXaKybr%2FPsqmoZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jos-crisis-no-one-should-be-above-the-law-sultan-tells-buhari-govt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jos Crisis: No One Should Be Above The Law">&larr;
