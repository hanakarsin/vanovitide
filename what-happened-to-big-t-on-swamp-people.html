What's truly scary is that it seems to have stemmed from a seemingly benign cut he had suffered in his foot.</p><p>However, the problem grew and grew, and it turned into an infection that then spread to his bone. That's when the gator hunter began to experience a potentially life-threatening situation.</p><p>The reality TV personality shared photos of the damage the infection caused to his foot on social media, and the photos were pretty graphic. Unfortunately, because he didn't have health insurance, a GoFundMe was set up in his name to help crowdsource cash to help cover his medical bills.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Thankfully, strangers, fans of the show, and even some of his co-stars came to his aid. Daniel Edgar donated an alligator hung tag at a fundraiser auction to help raise some money to get Big T back on his feet again.</p><p>Thankfully, the treatment that Big T underwent seems to have been a success, and he has been seen on some recent episodes of the series.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to IMDb, Joseph "Big T" Richard Rodgers is featured in at least 15 episodes of the series. He first made his debut in Season 9 and was a hit with fans, so viewers certainly noticed his absence. Thankfully he's appeared on a recent episode in Season 12 of the program. The newest batch of episodes featuring the bayou adventures of pro gator hunters debuted on Feb. 4, 2021.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A new hunting season begins, and with overpopulation supercharging gator aggression, the threat of attack is higher than ever.

It also doesn't hurt that they're getting paid per episode to appear in the show either, just doing what they do and walking the people watching at home through their process.</p><p>Troy Landry reportedly earns some $30,000 per month while filming Swamp People which doesn't include the money he makes off of gator hunting.
