We spill what it was and how everyone’s reacting.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a> experimental dating series <a href=#>Love Is Blind</a> can best be described as a wild ride. It premiered on Feb. 13, and we've been buckled in to see what happens next ever since.</p><p>The premise? Contestants get to know — and get engaged to — each other without ever laying eyes on one another beforehand. But that's not the only thing that has viewers' jaws dropping, because contestant (and self-proclaimed villain) Jessica Batten damn near broke the Internet in five seconds flat.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Okay, so what did Jessica do on ‘Love Is Blind’?</h2><p>Ah, the million dollar question. In a nutshell, during a heated discussion with 25-year-old fiancé Mark Cuevas, the 34-year-old lowers her glass of red wine to let her dog have a sip, comments that "she loves wine," and continues to drink out of that same glass. Netflix took to Twitter and the whole thing quickly went viral.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The reactions to Jessica's dog drinking wine are mixed.</h2><p>Surprising no one, many fans immediately voiced concerned for the safety of Jessica's pup, Payton. Grapes are known to be toxic to dogs. They're not safe in any amount, with the potential for kidney failure. Moreover, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">alcohol itself</a> just isn't good for pups. Thankfully, it would take a good deal to kill a larger dog, like Payton, but that doesn't change the fact that it's not smart to take that risk.</p><p>Many people were simply grossed out she drank out of the same glass after. The feedback ranged from funny and lighthearted to accusatory, and Jessica felt compelled to address it directly.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jessica openly regrets the incident and adores her dog.</h2><p>After the highly-debated episode aired, Jessica took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> with a loving post about her resilient puppy pal. After ingesting a stick, Payton made it through a touch-and-go surgery that she wasn't expected to survive.</p><p>This happened during the show's filming, which Jessica says was a very stressful time for her.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>This is my doggy Payton. During the filming of the show in 2018, she ingested a very small piece of a stick. Unfortunately, this little stick lodged into her intestines in the perfect way that the vet had to perform surgery to remove it. While she was opened up on the table, the surgeon called me and told me she wouldn’t make it through since they needed to cut out most of the intestine. She was 5 years old. I was beside myself, devastated and all the while cameras were rolling. Fortunately, she made it through the surgery but they were certain she couldn’t overcome the post trauma. Every night after working and filming my struggles with whether love was blind or not, I would go lay with her in the ICU cage and every night I thought would be the last time I would see my pretty girl. This went on for ten days. The first picture is from a couple of weeks ago. My doggy Payton is resilient. Not only did she survive but she is thriving - happy and healthy and loving. She has taught me this very important thing about life...it is fleeting and even when circumstances seem overwhelming, we can overcome. ***Special shout out to the amazing and bad ass women vets at Blue Pearl for saving my baby - against all odds!

I love my dog more than anything and that was not something I would ever recommend anyone to do. I think I was just really uncomfortable. I don’t even remember doing it. I don’t know why I did that but it was definitely unnecessary for sure.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>But that's not the only thing she's switching up. She also wants to drink less, acknowledging that she drank more than usual during filming to calm her nerves.</p><p>“Sometimes you loosen up and these moments can kind of come out. I really wish that I would have been better about the drinking for me. I was really uncomfortable and so I had a few moments where I over-drank. If I could do anything differently it would be that I didn’t have so much to drink.”</p><p>Wishing Jessica and Payton health and love!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoby3sYyiqmaanJ67pXnJnqqsoZOW</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./epl-man-utd-to-replace-maguire-with-chelsea-defender.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Man United To Replace Maguire With Chelsea's Top Defender">&larr;
