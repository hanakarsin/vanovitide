His father was a DJ and introduced him to different kinds of music, including hip hop, country, and alternative rock. It was after the family moved to Grapevine, Texas, that Post decided he wants to begin a career in music. By fourteen, he had selected a stage name "Post Malone" and created his first mixtape by sixteen.</p><p>As a young adult, Post dropped out of college and later moved to the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, where he met producers FKi 1st and Sauce Lord Rich, who produced "White Iverson." The song was released to Soundcloud in February 2015 to critical acclaim, and in August of the same year, he signed a recording contract with Republic Records.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2016, Post Malone released his first album "Stoney," but later said the album was "mediocre" despite critical success for his single "Congratulations" featuring Quavo. In 2017, he released the first single for "Beerbongs & Bentleys," called "Rockstar," which skyrocketed him to success on the Billboard charts and at the Grammy Awards.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Post Malone</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Rapper, Singer, Songwriter</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $45 Million</p><p>Austin Post, better known by his stage name Post Malone, is a musician from Syracuse, New York.
