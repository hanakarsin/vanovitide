The Inspector-General of Police directs that you treat. Accept the assurances of my esteemed regards please.”</p><p>The aggrieved pastor claimed to have met Apostle Suleman in 2003 while he was in school and was later ordained into the Omega Fire Ministries as a pastor on June 9, 2006.</p><p>He claimed to have served as a pastor before leaving in 2019.</p><p>Pastor Davids in a series of videos posted on Instagram on Sunday said he started a relationship with his wife in secondary school and they courted for about 11 years before marriage but accused Apostle Suleman of sleeping with his wife and destroying his marriage.</p><p>He narrated as reported by Punch that “In 2008 he introduced his wife – who was still his fiancée at the time – to Apostle Suleman whom he regarded as his spiritual father and she told him that Suleman had been making advances at her and once invited her to Reliance Hotel, Benin, but he never regarded it as anything serious.”</p><p>He alleged that Apostle Suleman used the pretense of setting up a gospel television station and needing the help of his wife who as then, worked with the NTA to lure her into his bed in a hotel.</p><p>Davids lamented that the two of them slept with each other in the presence of his daughter, Michelle.</p><p>In his words, “My wife was a staffer with NTA Iruekpen, so Apostle Suleman reached out to her that they will need her to build Celebration TV and Rhema for Living. She would have to shuttle between Osun State and Auchi.</p><p>“She came back from Auchi to Osun State and said she wanted to talk to me that her conscience was pricking her. I asked what was it and she said that while in Auchi, Apostle Suleman lodged her at Uyi Grand Hotel and he came there and slept with her.</p><p>“And the moment she said that, the first thing that came to my mind was my daughter. I asked where was Michelle when this happened and she said Michelle was on the bed, pushed aside and I asked, ‘You mean you slept with a man with my daughter on the bed?’. I had to let it go because there was nobody I could tell and I couldn’t fight with Apostle Suleman… I forgave her but the amorous relationship continued. One thing I know is that my wife was hypnotised. This is not the woman I got married to, who I knew for 11 years.”</p><p>Davids explained further that his relationship with Apostle Suleman soon turned sour and he was suspended but after the suspension was lifted, he refused to return and then started receiving threats from Apostle Suleman.</p><p>It was during this period according to him that his wife left their home with three children and was given a church in Abuja to manage by Apostle Suleman.</p><p>“Apostle Suleman has given her a branch of the church in Utako, Abuja to head without permission. I am calling on Pastor David Oyedepo, Pastor Paul Enenche, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, Pastor Margaret Idahosa, CAN, PFN.</p><p>“Apostle Suleman has damaged my life. I have not seen my wife and children for two years and Apostle Suleman says if I ever go near them, he will have me taken out. I have a video where he said he will make me disappear. I don’t want to lose my life,” he alleged.</p><p>The wife, Pastor Edeko however, denied the allegations by her husband, claiming it was he who abandoned their marriage with the children.</p><p>She said her husband’s action made her want to commit suicide at a time but her son stopped her.</p><p>Pastor Edeko also denied having any sexual relationship with Apostle Suleman, adding that she did not even have easy access to him.</p><p>In her words, “There are recordings which I will upload. You told my brothers that I would crawl in the gutters. I told them not to do anything to you, that you are still the father of my kids. At some point, I contemplated suicide. I had written my suicide note, I had bought sniper because I could not fathom how I would live life in so much pain. I won’t drag you because of my children… you have done too much and it is enough. I am not hypnotised. I am not under a spell.”</p><p>She added, “I don’t know what you hope to achieve, I don’t know who paid you but the only thing I will say is haven’t you done enough? Are you not tired of flogging someone’s daughter in pain?</p><p>“You left me in Kano. You called me on a certain day that you were going to leave the marriage. I thought you were bluffing. I called my people and they can testify. My elder brother called you from the UK. You told them you were leaving the marriage. My elder brother told me you were bluffing.</p><p>“I remember I begged you and then I got to the office and I collapsed, according to what my principal said because I found myself in the hospital.”</p><p>Attempts to get Apostle Suleman’s reaction has so far proved abortive but Resident Pastor, Omega Fire ministry, Headquarters, Joseph Iyare, who responded on behalf of Apostle Suleman in a terse text message, said Pastor Davids is “frustrated by his own evil deeds”.</p><p>It will be recalled about four years ago, Apostle Johnson Suleman was caught in a sex allegation scandal involving <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Stephanie Otobo</a></strong> and a lady identified as Queen Esther.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye5FuZpqon6jBrbGMrKylnZ2Wu261zWanqKSZmLJuwNGorJuklWKzsL6MmqOlnZeasa3FjKyjnp2gnruoedaiq6Fln6OybrvFZp%2Biq12lrrTAzquqZq%2BZm7Jw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./moesha-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Moesha - Cast, Ages, Trivia">&larr;
